Mainnet Fork Networks are alternative implementations of the original blockchain network that allow developers to test and develop applications in a simulated environment without risking real assets.

Smart contracts need to be tested before they can be deployed on a blockchain network. This is because smart contracts are immutable and cannot be changed once they are deployed. 
If a smart contract has a bug, it can cause a lot of damage to the blockchain network and its users. 

There are many ways to test smart contracts. Most developers are already use Ganache [provided by Truffle] or Hardhat [provided by Hardhat] to test their smart contracts.
These tools are great for testing smart contracts, but they are not suitable for certain usecases.
for example
 - if your smart contract interacts with other contracts on the blockchain network which are not deployed on your local machine.
 - if your smart contract requires to use Tokens like USDC / WETH or any other assets that are not available on your local machine.

For the above use cases and many more, you need to use a Mainnet Fork Network.

Hardhat/Truffle Fork networks are temporary networks that are created by forking the main Ethereum network from a certain block number.
Meaning all the blocks till that block number are fetched only when required and new blocks are created for your transactions.

This allows you to test your contracts on the main Ethereum network but doing any actual transactions on the network.

You can do this localy using Hardhat or Truffle or you can use a service like Alchemy or Infura to do get the RPC of the network you want to fork.

## Here to setup a fork network

Hardhat

```bash
npx hardhat node --fork <network-rpc-of-the-network>
```

Truffle

```bash
ganache --fork <network-rpc-of-the-network>
```

### Tantheta Forks

In Most of usecases you should use these Local fork networks to test your contracts.
but sometimes it is required to have these netowrks available on the cloud.

Like 

- To build a preview of your dapp where users can interact with dapp-previews or demo-dapps without actually spending any money.
- To setup CI/CD pipeline for your contracts.
- To Beta test your contracts before deploying them on mainnet.
- To simulate transactions on Mainnet.

For these usecases you need to have cloud based fork networks. which can be costly to setup and maintain.

So we have setup a cloud based fork network for you to use. [Tantheta](https://tantheta.dev) 
We provide completly free RPC endpoints for you to use.
or you can create your own fork network on Tantheta and use it for your usecases which will be only accessible to you.
